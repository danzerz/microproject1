# Microproject1 - StyleEase

This is a simple Express.js project that serves a static website and provides a JSON API of products. It includes an Express server serving static HTML, CSS, and JS files, a JSON API endpoint (`/api/items`) that returns product data, and a front-end page that fetches and displays products using async/await. The design features a purple and white theme with fully centered content.

To run the project, first install dependencies by running `npm install`, then start the server using `npm start`. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/services.html`, then click the **Load Items** button to fetch and display product data.
